# Dokibird-Jam
This is the repository for Dokibird Reacts to Chains, a game created for the Doki Jam!

## About the game
The theme of the game jam was 'chain reactions'. I decided to take that literally, and make a game where you play as Dokibird reacting to a video about chains. The game was made in two weeks using Unity.
